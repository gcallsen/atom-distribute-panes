# Distribute Panes

Distribute all open panes evenly.

## How to Use

Can invoke with shortcut `cmd-alt-0` or by using the `Distribute Panes` command
in menu.

This is particularly useful if you use multiple panes and sometimes need to
enlarge text for others, or expand the pane to see code that isn't kept
within your visible column width.

This is most helpful when used with a package such as
[Atom Pane Layout](https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-layout)
